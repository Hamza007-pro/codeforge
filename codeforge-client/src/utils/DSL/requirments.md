SimplSchema: A Human-Friendly Database Design Language
Overview
SimplSchema is a simple language for defining database structures without knowing SQL. It allows you to define:

Data models (called entities)
Their properties (called fields)
How they connect to each other (called relationships)
Basic Syntax

1. Defining an Entity
   Code
   model Person {
   name: text required
   age: number
   email: text unique
   birthday: date
   }
   Key Points:

Use model instead of "entity" or "table"
Field types are simplified: text, number, date, boolean
Common rules are easy to read: required, unique 2. Relationships
Code
// One person has one profile
link Person -> Profile (one to one)

// One person can have many posts
link Person -> Post (one to many)

// Many students can take many courses
link Student <-> Course (many to many)
Key Points:

Use link to define relationships
Arrow shows the direction: -> (one way) or <-> (both ways)
Relationship type in plain English 3. Field Types
Simple Types:

text - For names, descriptions, emails
number - For age, quantity, price
date - For birthdays, deadlines
boolean - For yes/no values
list - For multiple values
file - For attachments, images 4. Field Rules
Code
model Product {
name: text required // Must have a value
price: number positive // Must be > 0
sku: text unique // Must be unique
description: text long // Long text field
inStock: boolean default:true // Starts as true
}
Available Rules:

required - Must have a value
unique - Must be different from others
default:value - Starting value
positive - Number must be > 0
long - For long text
list - Can have multiple values 5. Complete Example
Code
// Person and their profile
model Person {
name: text required
email: text unique required
age: number positive
}

model Profile {
bio: text long
avatar: file
social_links: text list
}

// Connect person to their profile
link Person -> Profile (one to one)

// Blog system
model Post {
title: text required
content: text long required
published: boolean default:false
created: date
}

// Person can write many posts
link Person -> Post (one to many)

// Tags for posts
model Tag {
name: text unique required
color: text
}

// Posts can have many tags
link Post <-> Tag (many to many)
Usage Guidelines
Planning Your Models:

Start by listing the main things you want to track
Think about what information you need for each
Consider how they relate to each other
Naming Best Practices:

Use clear, meaningful names
Start model names with a capital letter
Use lowercase for field names
Use underscore for multiple words (e.g., first_name)
Common Patterns:

Code
// User accounts
model User {
username: text unique required
email: text unique required
active: boolean default:true
joined_date: date
}

// Settings pattern
model Settings {
theme: text default:"light"
notifications: boolean default:true
language: text default:"en"
}

link User -> Settings (one to one)

// Categories pattern
model Category {
name: text unique required
description: text
}

model Item {
name: text required
price: number positive
}

link Category -> Item (one to many)
Error Prevention
Common mistakes to avoid:

Don't use spaces in names (use underscores)
Don't forget required fields for important data
Don't create unnecessary relationships
Use unique for fields that must be distinct
Good Practice:

Code
model Order {
order_number: text unique required
total: number positive required
status: text default:"pending"
created_at: date
}
Bad Practice:

Code
model Order {
// Missing required rules
order number: text // Space in name
total: number
Status: text // Capital letter
}

This documentation for SimplSchema is well-structured and clear, offering a user-friendly way to define database structures without diving into SQL. Here's a summary of how it stands out, along with areas where more detail or examples could further enhance its utility:

Key Strengths
Human-Readable Syntax:

The use of model and link makes it intuitive and reduces the technical barrier.
Rules like required, unique, and default are straightforward and meaningful.
Ease of Defining Relationships:

Relationships are clear with -> and <-> notations.
Plain English descriptions add to the simplicity.
Error Prevention Guidelines:

Clear do's and don'ts help users avoid common pitfalls in database design.
Automatic Features:

Simplifies common database functionalities, like IDs and timestamps, reducing the workload for developers.
Usage Patterns and Examples:

Offers practical patterns like User -> Settings or categories with items.
Covers both common and advanced use cases like many-to-many relationships with attributes.
Suggested Improvements
More Complex Relationship Attributes:

Expand on how to define attributes in a many-to-many relationship.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
link Student <-> Course {
enrolled_on: date required
grade: text
}
Validation and Custom Rules:

Introduce custom validations or constraints for fields, e.g., regex for text, range for numbers.
Database-Specific Mapping:

Briefly explain how SimplSchema translates into SQL for backends like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Real-World Example:

A complete example for an application, like a small e-commerce or a blog system, showing all features together.
Tooling and Integration:

Mention if there's a compiler or parser for SimplSchema to convert definitions into SQL schemas or code.
Expanded Example: E-Commerce System
plaintext
Copy code
// Models
model User {
username: text unique required
email: text unique required
password: text required
created_at: date
}

model Product {
name: text required
price: number positive required
description: text long
in_stock: boolean default:true
}

model Order {
order_number: text unique required
total: number positive required
status: text default:"pending"
created_at: date
}

// Relationships
link User -> Order (one to many)
link Order <-> Product {
quantity: number positive required
price_at_order: number positive
}
